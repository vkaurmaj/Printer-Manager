*** DISCLAIMER ***

I was not able to get the makefile working due to an error I could not fix that gave me permission denied errors. I credit this to my lack of knowledge on Java makefiles, and the lack of documentation and examples online didn't help the situation either. I have a makefile that compiles the project files, but doesn't run them.

HOWEVER, my code compiles and runs when my mainClass.java is compiled directly within my src folder. I have a working GUI as well, but I was unable to run the program itself with a makefile. I hope that at least partial credit can be awarded because I spent a total of 20+ hours on this project.
